A hackable c++ bar for dwm, provides customizable widget display. Uses async threads + modern c++, extremely low memory and cpu usage on idle. 

inspiration from the suckless philosphy of software.

## Customization
Edit the main.cpp bar vector, for the order and for which blocks to be displayed.  

## What I learnt
helped my grasp some modern C++ concepts, varients etc. Also learnt the importance of hardtyping when writing clean apis. Even though the project wasnt an API, hardtyping made it hard fo reven me to misuse types so can be used extensivelby in proggraming interfaces for others. Furthemore built some more intuition around template system and the compile time c++. Writing a make file was also interisting as a i usually stick to CMAKE.
